HOW TO USE THIS PACKAGE
By this Tutorial Package, we will guide you through the basics of Natural Language Processing with very minimal effort! The package is comprised of three main sections: 
1. What is NLP and how does it work?
2. The capabilities of NLP
3. Their limitations and future developments
There are complemented by an interactive software, where you can input your voice, and the software will return the script. This is one of the most powerful that has been created by NLP technologies these days. 
We recommend that you go through the package in order, as we reference former materials at some points.

1. What is NLP and how does it work?
This section is the most sophisticated, as it contains a lot of abstract ideas, yet have been simplified to the highest extend so that you can understand. The only notice for you is on the last section, about the mathematical concepts, it would be more appropriate for students with some knowledge about high school algebra (GCSE year 10). If you find it too challenging, you can skip it as it will not affect the later content. 

 










2. The capabilities of NLP
This section is less technical. We recommend you follow the narrative of Bob and Amy – our main characters. You should imagine the contexts that we gave, and potentially relate it to yourself. You shall repeat reading the Formal introduction – Bob’s story – Illustration structure throughout the section:

 

3. Their limitations and future developments
This follows a very similar structure to section 2. You should find the coloured examples easier to comprehend.
